These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. The parties agree that the federal and state courts residing in San Francisco County, California will have exclusive jurisdiction over these Terms.

19.4 Dispute Resolution.

If a dispute arises between You and Azureus, our goal is to provide You with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, You and Azureus agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or our services (a "Claim") in accordance with one of the subsections below or as we and You otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage You to first contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.

a) Choice of Law; Forum. These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute You may have against Azureus must be resolved by a court located in Santa Clara County, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

b) Arbitration Option. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

c) Improperly Filed Claims. All claims You bring against Azureus must be resolved in accordance with this Section 19.4 (Dispute Resolution). All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 19.4 (Dispute Resolution) shall be considered improperly filed.
